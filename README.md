### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me
<p align="left" name="body">
🎓&nbsp;Computer Science, Bachelors of Science at FSU (graduating December 2022)

I've always been interested in computers as a kid, and unabashedly will state it's because of video games. Sadly I didn't make my decision on what to pursue professionally until I got into college. Really wasn't that sure of myself as a kid, honestly bumbled along with different interests like Creative Writing and History. For a short, while it was also Music, I used to play the Euphonium in middle school and high school band and loved my time in the marching band.

I started thinking more about programming after taking an HTML course at my high school (Thanks Mr. Karmanos!). I truly came to the decision after taking Intro to C++ at TCC, my success in the class motivated me to push further into programming. I always had the issue of keeping my motivation during self-learning as a kid, and I greatly appreciate that it changed.

I'm trying to do my best juggling with my time and interests:

  - learning in and outside of school
  - studying
  - practicing programming
  - finding time to relax and just game

Very simple interests.

🔭 Currently I'm trying to:

  - 🌱 learn and pass my CS courses and other courses
  - 🌱 learn how to use Unity/gamedev
  - 🌱 and maybe look into machine learning (though I haven't done much with learning that so far)
  - come up with attainable project ideas (and not make myself drown in the process by overreaching)
