My name is Tyler Pease. I'm a CS student at FSU.

I've always been interested in computers as a kid, and unabashadely will state it's because of video games. Sadly I didn't make my decision on what to pursue professionally until I got into college. Really wasn't that sure of myself as a kid, honestly bumbled along with different interests like Creative Writing and History. I used to play the Euphonium in middle school and high school band, and loved my time in the marching band.

I'm trying to do my best juggling with my time and interests:

  - learning in and outside of school
  - practicing programming
  - finding time to relax and just game

Very simple interests.

Currently I'm trying to:

  - learn and pass my CS courses and other courses
  - learn how to use Unity/gamedev
  - and maybe look into machine learning (though I haven't done much with learning that so far)
